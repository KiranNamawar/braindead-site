# Analytics Setup Guide

Your analytics system is now fully configured and ready to use! Here's how to complete the setup:

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Analytics utility implemented** - Custom tracking system with comprehensive event handling  
✅ **Google Analytics 4 integration** - Ready to connect to your GA4 property  
✅ **Environment variables configured** - Analytics ID and feature flags set up  
✅ **Page view tracking** - Automatic tracking on route changes  
✅ **Tool usage tracking** - Already implemented in your pages  
✅ **Error tracking** - Built-in error reporting  
✅ **Performance tracking** - Ready for performance metrics  

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Get Your Google Analytics ID

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Create a new GA4 property for your website
3. Copy your Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### 2. Update Your Environment Variables

Replace the placeholder in your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace this line:
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# With your actual GA4 Measurement ID:
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-ABC123DEF4
```

### 3. Deploy and Test

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

That's it! Your analytics will start collecting data immediately.

## 📊 What's Being Tracked

### Automatic Tracking
- **Page views** - Every route change
- **Session data** - User sessions and anonymous IDs
- **Performance metrics** - Page load times and interactions

### Tool Usage Tracking
Your tools already track usage:
- Calculator operations
- QR code generations
- Password generations
- Color picker usage
- And more...

### Custom Events
You can track custom events anywhere in your app:

```typescript
import { trackEvent, trackToolUsage, trackError } from './utils/analytics';

// Track custom events
trackEvent('button_click', { button: 'download' });

// Track tool usage
trackToolUsage('calculator', 'calculation', { operation: 'add' });

// Track errors
trackError('api_error', { endpoint: '/api/data' });
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Privacy-First Setup
Your analytics is configured with privacy in mind:
- IP anonymization enabled
- No Google Signals
- No ad personalization
- Anonymous user IDs only

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Events logged to console and stored locally
- **Production**: Events sent to Google Analytics

### Rate Limiting
Analytics respects your existing rate limiting system and won't track spam events.

## 🎛️ Alternative Analytics Services

Want to use a different service? Easy to switch:

### Plausible Analytics
```bash
npm install plausible-tracker
```

### Mixpanel
```bash
npm install mixpanel-browser
```

### Simple Analytics
```bash
npm install sa-sdk-javascript
```

Just update the `initializeGA()` method in `src/utils/analytics.ts` to use your preferred service.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Working?
1. Check your `.env` file has the correct `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID`
2. Ensure `VITE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify your GA4 property is set up correctly

### Testing in Development
```javascript
// Open browser console and check:
localStorage.getItem('analytics_events')

// You should see stored events
```

### Viewing Stored Events
```javascript
import { analytics } from './utils/analytics';
console.log(analytics.getStoredEvents());
```
