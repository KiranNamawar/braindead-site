## Introduction

The Text Case Converter is a utility tool that allows users to transform text between different case formats. This tool will help users quickly convert text for various purposes such as coding (camelCase, snake_case), formatting titles, or preparing content for different contexts. The tool will provide a simple, intuitive interface with real-time conversion and support for multiple case formats.

2. WHEN the user selects a different case format THEN the system SHALL update the output text immediately.
3. WHEN the user enters text with multiple lines THEN the system SHALL preserve line breaks in the output.
4. WHEN the user enters text with special characters THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately based on the selected case format.

4. WHEN the user is on a device that doesn't support clipboard API THEN the system SHALL provide alternative instructions.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to handle edge cases and provide options for text transformation, so that I get the expected results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user inputs text with numbers THEN the system SHALL preserve the numbers in the output.
2. WHEN the user inputs text with acronyms (e.g., "NASA", "API") THEN the system SHALL provide an option to preserve acronyms in title case and sentence case.
3. WHEN the user inputs very long text THEN the system SHALL handle it without performance issues.
4. WHEN the user inputs text with consecutive spaces or special characters THEN the system SHALL normalize them according to the selected case format.
5. WHEN the user selects title case THEN the system SHALL NOT capitalize articles, conjunctions, and prepositions unless they are the first or last word.
